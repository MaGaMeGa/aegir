# aegir
Aegir, beside being associated with the oceans mainly, was also the brewer for the gods of Asgard.

This project aims to create a precise brewing platform using industrial-grade tools, based on Raspberry Pi3, and FreeBSD.

So far, the project is still heavily in development, not suitable for use, not even for testing.

# Project goals
As it can be seen from the part list from the project wiki, one of the goals is to utilize industrial-grade tools for the homebrewing process, trying to still be within reasonable financial limits. Probably the best example is building on T-type thermocouples with SLE (Special Limit of Error) cabling, which provides a quite decent error range of +- 0.5C.

For the initial development, the goal is to make it work in a 1-pump RIMS setup, without PWM valve controls
